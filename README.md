# SmokeChartJS
This library provides an easy way to draw 'Smoke Chart' style charts.

I really liked the 'Smoke Ping' style charts provided by [DslReports.com](https://www.dslreports.com/smokeping) and wasn't able to find a library to generate such a chart (I was probably looking for the wrong name of chart...). So I made this.
## Example Output
This is the output from loading 'index.html' in the examples folder. It shows the kilometers and MPG that I have tracked for my 2007 Honda Fit over the years.
